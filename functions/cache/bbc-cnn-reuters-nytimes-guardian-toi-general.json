The nearly two-hour performance, covering 22 songs from her dance pop catalogue, joins Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s postponed Homecoming in the pantheon of groundbreaking Coachella headliner sets \u2013 a fully realized vision of a pop master, a testament to years of hard-earned experience at the highest level, and a banger dance party with production and delivery in a league above her peers.
