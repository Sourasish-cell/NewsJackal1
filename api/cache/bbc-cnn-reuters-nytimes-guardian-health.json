Though the album is in fact more rock opera of sweeping adolescent feeling than political commentary, the opportunity for concert catharsis, if not actual change, is high; it\u2019s a historically excellent time to scream along to \u201cdon\u2019t want to be an American Idiot.\u201dCatharsis was intermittently on hand during Green Day\u2019s headliner set on Saturday, a muddled affair that, although performed to punk perfection, landed more awkwardly than one would hope. To be fair, the California-based band, formed when frontman Billie Joe Armstrong and bassist Mike Dirnt were in high school in 1987, was dealt a tough hand as Coachella\u2019s headliner follow up to Lady Gaga, who transformed the desert into a gothic fever dream with a stunning and instantly canonical set on Friday night. And more pressingly, in following unofficial headliner Charli xcx, who preceded Green Day on the main stage Saturday with a larger crowd and a tighter grip on middle-finger energy and the color of puke green.

She wants me to choose a London location I am unfamiliar with, so I can experience her ideas about the upsides of urban landscapes. In the book, Streets contemplates the powerful impact walking can have on our mood, thoughts and emotions, and how this can differ according to where and how we walk. While most people are aware of the benefits of walking in nature, Streets makes the case for urban environments, known as \u201cbrown spaces\u201d by developers. Surprisingly, churches, convents and cemeteries, all of which are found in cities, often offer a superabundance of wildlife. A study in one Berlin cemetery found 604 species, 10 of which were rare or endangered.Streets believes it is in cities that our collective ingenuity is most obvious.

His first non-academic book, When the Bulbul Stopped Singing, chronicled the 2002 siege of his hometown, Ramallah, while Palestinian Walks, which won the Orwell prize, traced how Israel\u2019s de facto occupation of the West Bank had fundamentally altered both its geography and its history. Last year, Shehadeh published What Does Israel Fear from Palestine?, his first book since the attacks of 7 October. It was a work in two parts: the first, a characteristically measured analysis of how history led us to this point; the second, a bitterly furious record of the devastation wrought upon Gaza. The overwhelming impression was of a man who, after decades of engagement, had finally, tragically, succumbed to despair.So it is an unexpected relief to find in Forgotten something different: a Shehadeh who is engaged, forensic, alert to history\u2019s weight but unwilling to let it crush him. Perhaps this is due to the presence of his co-author, his wife, the academic Penny Johnson. The prose remains lawyerly, precise to the point of fastidiousness, but the collaboration lends it a quiet strength. The first-person plural voice used throughout the book is intimate yet resolute, while the occasional references to \u201cRaja\u201d and \u201cPenny\u201d in the third person suggest a certain distance \u2013 a recognition that they, too, are subjects in this vast historical tragedy, just as much as its narrators.

At the heart of each of these controversies is the question of how Muslims should relate to western societies, and western societies relate to them. For some, the answer is easy. On the one side, many claim Islam to be incompatible with western values and that allowing Muslims to settle here has led to what they regard as the degeneration of western societies. On the other are those who insist there is no issue, and those who raise concerns are bigots. Both are wrong. There are issues about Muslims and integration that need discussing, but those issues are rarely as presented in these debates.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Gaga\u2019s replacement performance, in her country-tinged Joanne era \u2013 as usual, she was years ahead of the pop curve \u2013 more than sufficed; perhaps only Beyonc\u00e9 can hold a candle to her in terms of true-blue live performance ability, and she delivered the set of a consummate entertainer and generational talent. But Gaga felt that she had unfinished business. \u201cI\u2019ve had a vision I\u2019ve never been able to fully realize at Coachella for reasons beyond our control,\u201d she wrote in an Instagram post announcing her return to the desert for another headliner slot this spring. \u201cI have been wanting to go back and do it right, and I am.\u201dDid she ever. Gaga, more than any other contemporary pop star, has approached pop as transmogrification, live performance like a hunter \u2013 the piercing gaze, transparent hunger and annihilating focus of an apex predator. And with Gagachella, as her fans have already termed a thesis statement of a set, she goes in for the kill. You knew from the minute she appeared in full deranged queen regalia, the head of a multi-story hoop skirt that opened to reveal a birdcage prison of backup dancers, that the vision was nigh. The nearly two-hour performance, covering 22 songs from her dance pop catalogue, joins Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s postponed Homecoming in the pantheon of groundbreaking Coachella headliner sets \u2013 a fully realized vision of a pop master, a testament to years of hard-earned experience at the highest level, and a banger dance party with production and delivery in a league above her peers.
